# Image Classification using AWS SageMaker Studio Capstone Project

# Project Overview
	Machine learning has a phenomenal range of application in the health sciences. This project proposal will go over the complete pipeline to build a model that can determine the dementia level of an Alzheimer's patient from their MRI image.
This tutorial highlights the prediction of MRI Alzheimer insights through building a CNN Model using Some Python libraries trying to get the highest accuracy of prediction.

# Dataset Background
	We'll be using a  [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset) for our tutorial which already has augmented data with 4 labels and not biased  that we can go through modeling after just splitting our data.

# Problem Statement
    The project’s objective is to build a CNN model with high accuracy to predict the stages of Alzheimer from the MRI scanned images to help physicians distinguish between different stages easily with high performance to prescribe the suitable medication for cure.
